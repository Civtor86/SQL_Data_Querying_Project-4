Analysis of Financing Data for New Investment

Task description
You are a data analyst working for a company planning to venture  
into a new market involving financial services. In line with this,  
it is requesting insights on sources of financing companies tap  
into when entering the said industry. 

Decision-makers will use insights from your report  
for their alternatives analysis as they explore probable  
sources of financing to start offering the new service.

The dataset is a subset from an open data set; should you wish to peruse the
source, you can find at the following website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arindam235/startup-investments-crunchbase.

Tasks:
1. Prepare the dataset for the analysis by creating a new table selecting   the records where the 
market is financial services.   Keep in mind that the values in this column are misspelled

2. Provide descriptive analytics that presents the number of observations of companies operating 
in financial services and their average, minimum, and maximum seed funding.

3. Aware of the reality that equity crowdfunding is a bit rare in financial services, determine 
whether or not there has been a previous instance where a startup offering financial services 
received equity crowdfunding. If there was, provide details of the company, such as the country 
it operates in, the year it was founded, its status (whether or not it is still operating), and the 
amount of equity crowdfunding it acquired.

4. Determine whether or not a significant outlier in terms of total funding (USD) exists among 
companies that offer financial services.   An outlier is an extremely high or low value. Provide 
details about this outlier,   such as its country, status, year founded, and total funding (USD).

5. Excluding the significant outlier, provide insights on the company regarding the usual financing 
sources for businesses that offer financial services. Export your data from SQL to MS Excel, and 
create a data visualization that presents the average funds acquired from financing sources such 
as equity crowd-sourcing, undisclosed sources, convertible notes, debt financing,   and private 
equity.
